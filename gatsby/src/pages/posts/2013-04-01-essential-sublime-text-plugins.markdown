<h2>Sublime Text is <em>awesome.</em></h2>

<p>Nearly every day I find something amazing about Sublime Text that completely changes the way I work. At first I was wowed by the find-and-replace alternative: selecting a block of code and pressing &#8984; + D to select each subsequent occurrence. To this day I love watching 20+ lines of code all change at once while I type in the proper code edits.</p>

<p>Recently, I came across some Sublime Text plugins that left me speechless. Here are a few.</p>

<ul>
     <li><a href="https://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control">Package Control</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://emmet.io/">Emmet (formerly Zen Coding)</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://wbond.net/sublime_packages/prefixr">Prefixr</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-2-git/wiki">Git</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://wbond.net/sublime_packages/svn">SVN</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://github.com/dz0ny/LiveReload-sublimetext2">LiveReload</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="https://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control">Package Control</a></h3>
<p>This one is obvious. It's your pathway to all that is good in Sublime Text. I almost forgot to add it since it feels like Sublime Text came with it. It makes it super easy to install packages, and knows how to get a hold of basically all of them.</p>


<h3><a href="https://emmet.io/">Emmet</a></h3>
<p>When I switched from Coda 2 to Sublime text, I really missed the HTML shortcuts. Automatic tag closing, HTML &amp; CSS hints, and a few other things. This plugin brings it all back, and a ton more. You can quickly create HTML snippets with shortcuts, for example:</p>

<span class="inline-code">div#foo + Tab</span> gives you <span class="inline-code">&lt;div id="foo"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</span>

<p>This makes for very fast &amp; efficient coding in a language that can become rather time consuming. It also gives you snippets like meta tags, beginning html, head, and body tag structure and more. It's basically a no brainer.</p>


<h3><a href="https://wbond.net/sublime_packages/prefixr">Prefixr</a></h3>
<p>Using browser specific prefixes on CSS is <em>almost</em> a thing of the past, but for now we've got to put up with it. Prefixr makes this easier by writing out all the -webkit- -moz- and -khtml-'s we love to hate.</p>


<h3><a href="https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-2-git/wiki">Git</a> &amp; <a href="https://wbond.net/sublime_packages/svn">SVN</a></h3>
<p>Want to run Git or SVN commands in a command line style, but without actually leaving your text editor and opening up Terminal? Well Sublime Text can do that too with this plugin. Just open up the Command Pallet (&#x21E7; + &#8984; + P) and begin to type Git (or SVN) and a list of commands will show up. You can check the status of files, commit changes, revert, push, etc. all from Sublime Text. Very cool.</p>


<h3><a href="https://github.com/dz0ny/LiveReload-sublimetext2">LiveReload</a></h3>
<p>From time to time, I use <a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a>, which reloads your browser each time you save the file you're working on. It can also do a million other things. LiveReload, both a browser plugin and a Sublime Text plugin, can also take care of reloading your browser upon saving the file. It saves you a decent amount of time &mdash; time better spent writing code than hitting &#8984; + R over and over.</p>

<p>I'll be adding to this list as I find more cool things / plugins for Sublime Text. If you've got any suggestions, or if I left out any essentials, let me know!</p>

<p>Cheers,<br />Matt</p>
